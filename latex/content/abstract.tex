This thesis presents a machine learning based approach to construct initial electron densities directly from overlap matrices to accelerate SCF convergence. We explore whether a graph neural network (GNN) can map atomic overlap integrals in an atom-centred basis to initial electron densities in that same basis, thereby significantly reducing SCF iteration count. Although graph neural networks excel at learning molecular descriptors and energies, their potential to reduce SCF iterations through tailored initialization remains largely unaddressed. We introduce a simple message passing GNN that predicts initial densities from atomic coordinates and overlap integrals. The GNN is trained and evaluated on three 500 molecule subsets of the QM9 dataset (isomers, isomers MD trajectories and a stratified sample). With a reduction in mean SCF iterations of 25\% to 35\% compared to a superposition of atomic densities (SAD) initialization on unseen data, we demonstrate the potential of GNN-based density initialization to dramatically lower computational costs in electronic structure simulations, aiding high-throughput materials discovery and molecular design.
