I'm profoundly thankful to Prof. Andreas W. Hauser and Ralf Meyer for letting me choose a topic dear to my heart and giving me the freedom to explore it in my own way. Their guidance and support were invaluable throughout this journey.

I also want to express my gratitude towards the rest of our group, especially Dominik, for the many insightful conversations we shared. A special thanks goes to Nadja, for her thoughtful critiques and editorial support. To all my friends and collegues, your support meant the world to me and made stressfull times much more bearable. My sincere gratitude goes to the FÃ¼rst Dietrichstein'sche Stiftung for their scholarship and the Institute of Experimental Physics for funding my master's thesis.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my parents, who always supported me uncondicionally throughout my studies. Their encouragement and belief in me have been a constant source of motivation.
