These have the special feature that common Gaussian exponents are shared between Slater-type 2s and 2p functions. Use of these atomic orbitals in self-consistent molecular-orbital calculations is shown to lead to values of atomization energies, atomic populations, and electric dipole moments which converge rapidly (with increasing size of Gaussian expansion) to the values appropriate for pure Slater-type orbitals. The ζ exponents (or scale factors) for the atomic orbitals which are optimized for a number of molecules are also shown to be nearly independent of the number of Gaussian functions. A standard set of ζ values for use in molecular calculations is suggested on the basis of this study and is shown to be adequate for the calculation of total and atomization energies, but less appropriate for studies of charge distribution.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree-Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%-97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

  abstract = {Abstract According to the classification of Jacob's Ladder proposed by Perdew, density functional approximations (DFAs) on the top (fifth) rung add the information of the unoccupied Kohn–Sham orbitals, which hold the promise to enter the heaven of chemical accuracy. In other words, we expect that a much higher accuracy with a broader applicability than the existing DFAs would eventually be achieved on the fifth rung. Nonetheless, Jacob's Ladder itself does not offer a recipe for how to manipulate the unoccupied Kohn–Sham orbitals on the construction of a successful fifth rung DFA. In this article, we briefly review two successful types of the fifth rung DFAs, that is, random-phase approximation (RPA) and doubly hybrid approximation (DHA). The limitations of RPA and DHA will be introduced in the context of the so-called self-interaction error (SIE)/nondynamic correlation error (NCE) dilemma in the world of density functional theory. We propose the development strategy for DHAs to address the general concern about the future of advanced DFAs on the fifth rung. We share our experience here, based on the relevant efforts recently made by the authors and their co-workers, aiming to resolve the SIE/NCE dilemma and to extend the applicability of DHAs from the chemistry of the main group elements to that of the transition metals.
